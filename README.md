# LearnSQL

This project was created as a personal learning resource to teach myself SQL and improve my overall tech stack.

## Project Structure

- **Lessons/**  
  A series of SQL lesson scripts, each focusing on a specific SQL concept or feature. Lessons progress from basic data retrieval to advanced topics such as transactions, stored procedures, cursors, and triggers.

## Lesson Topics

The lessons cover, but are not limited to:

- Basic data retrieval (`SELECT`)
- Sorting and filtering data
- Using wildcards and advanced filtering
- Calculated fields and manipulation functions
- Aggregate functions and grouping data
- Subqueries and joins (inner, outer, self, natural)
- Combining queries with `UNION`
- Inserting, updating, and deleting data
- Creating and manipulating tables
- Using views
- Transaction processing (`START TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`)
- Stored procedures and cursors
- Advanced SQL features: constraints, indexes, triggers, and security

Each lesson is a standalone `.sql` file with example queries and explanations in comments.
